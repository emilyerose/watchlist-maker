# WatchMeNow

## Description
Webpage that allows you to create a list of your movies-to-be-watched with a tagging and filtering system focused on displaying the streaming services where the content is available. You can search for movies and TV shows through the OMDB API, which draws on the IMDb database. Content can then be added and subtracted from the watchlist.
